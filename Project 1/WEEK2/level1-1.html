    The Sun Rising
             <p>By John Donne</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busy old fool, unruly sun,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why dost thou thus,<br>Through windows, and through curtains call on us?<br>Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late school boys and sour prentices,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call country ants to harvest offices,<br> Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,<br> Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy beams, so reverend and strong. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why shouldst thou think? <br> I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink, <br> But that I would not lose her sight so long;  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If her eyes have not blinded thine,  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether both th' Indias of spice and mine. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me. <br> Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,  <br>And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's all states, and all princes, I, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing else is. <br>Princes do but play us; compared to this, <br>All honor's mimic, all wealth alchemy. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou, sun, art half as happy as we, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that the world's contracted thus.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To warm the world, that's done in warming us. <br>Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;<br> This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere.</p>
