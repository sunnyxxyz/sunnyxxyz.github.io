       <p>Busy old fool, unruly sun,<br>Why dost thou thus,<br>Through windows, and through curtains call on us?<br>Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?<br>Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide <br>Late school boys and sour prentices,<br>Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride, <br>Call country ants to harvest offices,<br> Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,<br> Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.</p>

        <p>Thy beams, so reverend and strong. <br>Why shouldst thou think? <br> I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink, <br> But that I would not lose her sight so long;  <br>If her eyes have not blinded thine,  <br>Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,  <br>Whether both th' Indias of spice and mine. <br>Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me. <br> Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,  <br>And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.</p>
            <p>She's all states, and all princes, I, <br>Nothing else is. <br>Princes do but play us; compared to this, <br>All honor's mimic, all wealth alchemy. <br>Thou, sun, art half as happy as we, <br>In that the world's contracted thus.<br>Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be.<br>To warm the world, that's done in warming us. <br>Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;<br> This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere.</p></div>
