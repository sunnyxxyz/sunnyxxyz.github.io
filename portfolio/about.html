      <p>Hello, 
I am a sunny boy who comes from local, Shanghai. I have six educational experiences in the United State. I get an associate degree of Fine Arts, emphasis in Graphic Design. And, I get a bachelor degree in Graphic Design. 

I have great communication skills. Because of my personality and my study experience, I am able to make success of interpersonal relationships, including personal relationships and working relationships. In addition, I have strong English skills in speaking and writing.

For working, I am a highly performing team player that depend on the characteristics of my personality. Among those that I believe in unity rather than selfishness in people, sharing of knowledge, good listening skills that will make known of varied perspectives, and working towards harmony. On the latter, the good listening skills and friendliness help towards reducing conflict in the team. </p>
