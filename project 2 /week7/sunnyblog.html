        <h4>Kanye West’s Secret Weapon Is His Versatility</h4>
       <img alt="" width="512" height="341" src="kanye-west.jpg">
        <p>Late last year, in what seemed like a lost bet with his label Def Jam, Kanye West did a nationwide commercial radio tour. I’m not talking about the next-level Zane Lowe BBC interview everyone raved over, I’m talking about Kanye going to pop and “urban”-format radio stations with cheesy DJs.</p>

                <p>Hello
Shine…Shine..
Oh! Mr. Bright Smile
Filled with every thoughts & happy feeling
The cupcake to my heart and the sweetest seranade
You bright up my light
the excitement and the joy I’ve found
And i knew it from the start that this is
between
me

        <H3>Dead Leaves</H3>
                <p>The breaking dead leaves ’neath my feet
A plaintive melody repeat,
Recalling shattered hopes that lie
As relics of a bygone sky.

Again I thread the mazy past,
Back where the mounds are scattered fast—
Oh! foolish tears, why do you start,
To break of dead leaves in the heart?
            </p>

         <div class="text3">
        <H3>No, Don’t</H3>
                <p>
You can’t sit in the cement highchair, sit in this landscape room, this
come to crime test, alive here for feeling, or take me
to nothing sound-past longing with the lion
who won’t eat you, who won’t eat me, facing
the animal garden, shaking his yellow haystack head.
